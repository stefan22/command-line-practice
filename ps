ps

  For viewing the processes running on the system.  It provides a snapshot of the current processes along with 
  detailed information like user id, cpu usage, memory usage, command name etc.
  
  Example:
  
    - To see all processes running in your computer:
      ps x
      
    - You can also filter out processes using grep:
      ps x | grep bash
      
  
  Note > If you have a few terminal windows open in parallel...you're going to have a "bash" process for everyone
         of them.
