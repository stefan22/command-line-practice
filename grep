grep

  Does a search inside of a file or a group of files.
  
  It takes two parameters:
  
    - What you want to search for
    - What file(s) you want to search through
    
  
  Example:
  
    grep dummy *.txt      //It searches for the word "dummy" inside all text files
    
    
    Using grep with find:
    
      find ~ -name "*.txt" -print | grep dummy      //finds all text files and prints only those with "dummy" in it.
